# AngularJS TodoMVC Example

> This is a basic todo list that has been implemented in angularJS. If it is allowed it is persistent and uses local
> storage. Items can be added to the list by typing in the initial displayed box, and finalised by pressing enter.
> Items can be marked as complete by clicking the check mark on the left side. All items can be marked as complete by
> pressing the double down arrow icon. Individual items can be removed by pressing the red X on the right side, and
> clicking the button in the lower right corner will remove all completed items.
